-Outcomes based on goals show that the companies with goal less than $1000 have the higest success rate or 75.81% while the companies with goal between $45000 and $49999 have the lowest success rate of 0%
However, since the number of companies that set their goal higher than $45000 are so few compared to that of companies with lower goal, it is unreliable to make a conclusion that companies with higher goals are likely to fail.
